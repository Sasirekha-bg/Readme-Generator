# Readme-Generator

## Description
Readme-Generator is a Streamlit-based application that fetches content from a specified GitHub repository and generates a README file based on the fetched data. This tool is designed to simplify the process of creating a README file for any GitHub project, based on the repository structure and content.

## Installation
To install and run the Readme-Generator, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Readme-Generator.git
   cd Readme-Generator
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add your GitHub Personal Access Token:

   ```
